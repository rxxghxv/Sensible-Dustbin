Sensible Dustbin 
  Prototype 1: BrainToBin
  This is the prototype that can be magnetically attached to any dustbin that is being currently used.
  Here we are using:
  1. Arduino
  2. MQ-135 gas senor
  3. Breadboard mini
  4. Jumper wires
  5. Buzzer (5v)
  6. Battery 9V
  7. Plastic Casing
  The code is attached and can be found.

  Prototype 2: Sensible Dustbin
  This is the main prototype that is a fully finished product and can be used at public places like parks, schools, malls and even at homes.
  We have the following division:
  Lvl 1-> Organic Decaying                                                Non-Decaying
          (Includes kitchen wastes like                                (Everything else)
           fruits, vegetables that might 
           stink easily)
  Lvl 2->                                                  Metallic                          Non- Metallic
  Lvl 3-> (not included in this prototype)                                                Wet                  Dry
  Method: We start with the gas sensor that senses any presence of ethylene/ stinky gases that are released as the organic matter starts to decay which has a very high rate 
  in this fashion. Then the metal and non metal is done simply by the proximity/ inductive sensor. There are two compartments at each level divide in 2:1 ratio. For example, 
  if organic has a compartment of volume v, then non-decaying has 2v volume which has further divisions of 2v/3 and v/3.
  The entrance of waste is controlled by a servo motor which rotates the lid of each such compartment.
  
  Here are the things used to make this:
  1. Arduino
  2. Lithium-ion Battery (12v)
  3. Breadboard
  4. MQ-135 gas senor
  5. HW201 IR sensor
  6. N-12 proximity sensor (NPN)
  7. Servos(2)
  8. DC motor
  9. Motor Driver L298N
  10. Voltage divider circuit
  11. Jumper wires
  12. Plastic Casing
